  "description": "This repository contains the code for simulating and analyzing turbulent brain dynamics in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI)\nusing a whole-brain model based on coupled Hopf oscillators.\nThe model integrates empirical data—such as structural connectivity and resting-state fMRI—to capture altered dynamical regimes in lesioned brains\nthrough a simulated attack approach.\n\nThe repository is organized into six folders:\n(1) model-free – whole-brain turbulent-like dynamics;\n(2) model-based – Hopf whole-brain model with intact structural connectivity;\n(3) model-based-lesions – Hopf model after simulated attacks;\n(4) CONN_preprocessing – CONN toolbox denoising outputs;\n(5) time-series – inputs for model-free/model-based analyses;\n(6) lesion-masks – code for the simulated attack approach.\n\nFor detailed methodology and usage instructions, please see the full README file:\n[README.md](https://github.com/decolab/martinezmolina_TBI_turbu_les_Hopf/blob/main/README.md) (https://github.com/decolab/martinezmolina_TBI_turbu_les_Hopf/blob/main/README.md)",
